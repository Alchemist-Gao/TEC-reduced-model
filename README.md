# How to use the code?
In order to run the code you need to install the developer version of PyBaMM, as the model need is not yet on the released version. To install the developer version follow the instructions [here](https://pybamm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install-from-source.html). Following the PyBaMM recommendations, we strongly recommend to install it in a Python virtual environment, in order not to alter any distribution Python files.
